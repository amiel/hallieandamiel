  <dt>Where</dt>
  <dd><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/AGv7">Fairbanks, Alaska</a></dd>
  
  <dt>The Ceremony</dt>
  <dd>We will assemble friends and family on Murphy Dome, (Murphy Dome is one of the highest peaks in the Fairbanks area), to witness and support our union.</dd>
  
  <dt>Hey, that&rsquo;s a long ways away!</dt>
  <dd>You should come anyway because it&rsquo;ll be a really fun gathering with lots of really cool people and Alaska is awesome. However, we are planning to have another celebration in the Seattle area for those who can&rsquo;t make it all the way to Alaska and for those who want to party twice as much.</dd>
