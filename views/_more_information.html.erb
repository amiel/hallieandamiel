  <dt>The Ceremony</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>We will assemble on Murphy Dome at 2:30 to witness and support our union (Murphy Dome is one of the highest peaks in the Fairbanks area).</p>

    <p>
      The ceremony will be outside, so be prepared for wind, sun, and possibly light right (if it rains too hard we'll go inside).
      Also, wear comfortably supportable shoes as there is a bit of a walk; high heels are not recommended.
      That said, you are probably still wondering, &ldquo;what should I wear?&rdquo; Well, all I can say is <em>express yourself</em>.
    </p>

    <p>At some point we will have a &ldquo;tossup&rdquo; (where everyone throws something into the air). Bring something to throw (hats, juggling props, small children, rubber ducks, etc).</p>

  <dt>Celebrating...</dt>
  <dd>
    <!-- <p>
      We&rsquo;d like the weekend to be a community gathering. Plan to be here Friday night to join in the fun as you share your non-material gifts with us in the form of a song, dance, poem, skit, etc.
    </p> -->

    <p>There will be a reception at the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/G2iF" rel="external">Mushers Hall</a> after the ceremony.</p>
    <p>At the reception there will be appetizers, dinner, and a contra-dance. Bring <strong>dancing shoes</strong> and <strong>instruments</strong>.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Gifts &amp; Sharing</dt>
  <dd>Due to the fact that we live on a boat and therefore cannot acquire any more material possessions (or we will not have space for sleeping), the gift of your presence is enough. However, if you just can&rsquo;t help yourself, contributions to our honey moon travel fund will be graciously accepted as well.</dd>


  <!-- <p>
    If you are coming from out of town, there are plenty of things to do aside from watching us get married, and almost as fun. This is the excuse you need to add Alaska to your list of states youâ€™ve been to.
